# Securing the Unknown: A Methodology for Auditing Smart Contracts

Blockchain technology inherits most threats and vulnerabilities from other software-based systems but it also comes with new security considerations and attack vectors which are evolving rapidly. With multiple years of experience in the blockchain space and decades of experience in security, we've created a unique testing methodology that bridges the old and new. Services relying on smart contracts are complicated and during this lightening talk you will learn how we are able to quickly digest system flows, business logic, and other specifications to deliver security recommendations that not only look to protect platforms today but also in the future. This presentation focuses on use of static and dynamic tools efficiently within your workflow to hack smart contracts faster and better!
